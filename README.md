Project Overview

When I first started building the Local Food Wastage Management System, my goal was to create a platform that could connect food providers like restaurants, grocery stores, and even households with recipients like NGOs, food banks, and community centers. The idea was to reduce waste by making surplus food easily accessible to those who need it most.

It is a fully interactive, database connected system that not only enables redistribution but also cleans, updates, and visualizes the data in real time. I also added automatic data cleaning in the process. Now, whenever I insert or delete a record, names are properly formatted, contact numbers are standardized, and statuses are kept consistent. This makes sure the database stays clean and analytics remain trustworthy without constant manual intervention.

I added SQL Queries & Results section that cover everything from city wise provider and receiver counts to food type distribution, claim success rates, and wastage tracking. To make the data more engaging, I integrated Plotly bar charts that shows the query’s output whether it’s a simple two column result or something more complex that needs grouped bars.

Managing the data is easier with the Update Database section, where I can run cleaning scripts, manually edit records, and even export cleaned datasets in a tab separated format. The Add New Record feature lets me insert new rows into any table, while automatically applying the same cleaning logic before saving. I also added a Delete Record section for safely removing outdated or incorrect entries.

Objectives:
1. To minimize food wastage by redistributing excess food from providers to those in need.
2. To build a user-friendly platform that allows food providers to list available surplus food items.
3. To enable recipients to claim and schedule pickups or deliveries of surplus food.
4. To track food listings, claims, and distribution status to ensure transparency and accountability.
5. To promote community engagement and raise awareness about sustainable food consumption practices.

System Charts:
1. Total Providers count in each city
2. Total Receivers count in each city
3. Food provider contribution for distribution
4. First POC for food providers in each city
5. Receivers who have claimed the most food
6. Total quantity of food available from all providers
7. Food listing providers by type of food
8. Top 10 food providers
9. Most commonly available Food type
10. Food claims made for each food item
11. Provider with highest number of successful claims
12. Provider with successful food category
13. Food claims percentage
14. Average quantity of food claimed by receiver
15. Status count of Meal_Type
16. Most claimed Meal_type
17. Quantity of food donated by each provided
18. Quantity of food donated by each provided by food_type
19. Food Wastage in each city

Impacts & Benefits

1. As a developer, I found that implementing the Local Food Wastage Management System provided valuable insights into the intersection of technology and social good. Building the platform required thoughtful design of database schemas, user interfaces, and logic to ensure both providers and recipients could interact seamlessly.
2. The project emphasized the importance of transparency and traceability in food redistribution, which not only builds trust but also enables better data-driven decisions for all stakeholders.
3. Personally, I learned how technology can be leveraged to address real-world challenges like food insecurity and environmental sustainability, and how collaborative efforts between communities and technologists can create meaningful impact.

Conclusion

The Local Food Wastage Management System demonstrates how digital solutions can bridge the gap between surplus and need, fostering a more sustainable and equitable food ecosystem.
Ongoing engagement, maintenance, and feature enhancements will be crucial for the platform’s continued success and broader adoption.
This project has reinforced my commitment to using my technical skills for societal benefit, and I look forward to exploring further innovations in this domain.
